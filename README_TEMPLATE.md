# README template

The canonical section order and contents for `README.md`. Keep `README.md` in this
shape so releases and feature additions land in predictable places. Sections are
listed top-to-bottom in the order they must appear. **Required** sections always
exist; **Optional** sections appear only when relevant (and keep their slot in the
order when they do).

Separate every top-level section with a `---` horizontal rule.

## 1. Title, badges & elevator pitch — *Required*

- `# <Integration name>` as the H1.
- **Badge block**, two rows, in this order:
  1. Status/meta shields (`style=for-the-badge`): HACS, GitHub Release, downloads,
     license, commit activity, maintenance year.
  2. Workflow status badges (Tests, Validate, hassfest) — add each one when its
     workflow exists under `.github/workflows/`.
- One-sentence **value proposition** naming the portal it reads from.
- An **`It gives you:`** bulleted feature list — each bullet **bold lead-in** + plain-English
  benefit (Energy dashboard, Daily sensors, One login, Late data handled, No add-ons…).
- A closing **call-out** for the headline differentiator (e.g. "No Browserless, no Chrome").

## 2. Why this exists — *Required*

The motivation / problem statement. Two or three short paragraphs: what the portal does and
doesn't offer, what changed (mandatory one-time codes broke the browser-driven 1.x), and why
the plain-HTTP approach is better. No tables, no config detail.

## 3. What's new in vX.Y.Z — *Required*

- Heading carries the **current release version** and the 🆕 emoji.
- 1–2 paragraphs in plain language describing the headline change for **this** release only.
- Include an **"Upgrading?"** note when behaviour or migration affects existing users.
- Close with links: `[CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md)` · `[release notes](…/releases/tag/vX.Y.Z)`.
- **Update this every release** — version in the heading, body, and the release-notes link
  must all match the new tag.

## 4. Prerequisites — *Required*

Numbered `### N. <topic>` subsections covering everything needed before install, in
dependency order. For this project:

1. **Portal account** — a working my.southeastwater.com.au login with a digital meter, and
   access to the email address or phone the portal sends one-time codes to.
2. **Recorder** — long-term statistics need the recorder (on by default); note that
   history is kept in the recorder database, not in this integration.
3. **Energy dashboard** (optional) — only if the user wants the water card.

Use `<details><summary>…</summary>` for long optional snippets so the section stays scannable.

## 5. Installation — *Required*

- Dashboard screenshot up top:

  ```markdown
  ![South East Water sensors in Home Assistant](images/dashboard.png)
  ```

- `### HACS (recommended)` numbered steps.
- `### Manual` numbered steps.
- `### Removing the integration` — what is deleted and what is deliberately left behind
  (the `sew_water:water_usage_mains` statistic).
- A closing note on runtime deps (aiohttp ships with HA; nothing to install).

## 6. Configuration — *Required*

- Entry-point sentence (Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → …).
- A line stating how many wizard steps there are and which are conditional.
- One `### Step N — <name>` subsection per wizard step. **Each step leads with a
  screenshot of that wizard page**, then a **field table**
  (`| Field | Default | Description |`, drop the Default column where it doesn't apply).
- Mark conditional steps in the heading (e.g. "(only if the portal asks for a code)").
- `### Options` for the options flow, same field-table shape.
- `### Re-authentication` describing the reauth card and its steps.
- End with any operational ⚠️/heads-up call-outs.

Keep step numbers and field names in lockstep with `config_flow.py`/`strings.json`.

Per-step screenshot placeholders — one image per wizard step, named `config-stepN-<slug>.png`
under `images/`. Swap each placeholder for a real screenshot of that page:

```markdown
### Step 1 — Sign in
![Step 1 — Sign in](images/config-step1-signin.png)
<!-- placeholder: capture the credentials page -->

### Step 2 — Send code by
![Step 2 — Send code by](images/config-step2-channel.png)
<!-- placeholder: capture the Email / SMS chooser -->

### Step 3 — One-time code
![Step 3 — One-time code](images/config-step3-code.png)
<!-- placeholder: capture the code entry page -->
```

## 7. How it works — *Required*

- Bulleted explanation of each core behaviour (session reuse, trailing re-import, statistics
  vs sensors, 02:00 poll), in plain language with the *why*, not code detail.
- Link out to `DESIGN_DOCUMENT.md` for the protocol and statistics design.
- `### Energy dashboard` subsection: which statistic to add and why not the sensor.

## 8. Sensors — *Required*

Single table `| Sensor | Unit | Description |` listing every entity the integration
creates. Note diagnostic-only entities and any disabled by default.
Keep in sync with `sensor.py`.

## 9. Services — *Required*

Single table `| Service | Description |` of every registered service
(`<domain>.<service>`). Keep in sync with `services.yaml` / `__init__.py`.

## 10. Standalone tools — *Optional*

Present only while the repository ships user-facing CLIs. Describe each tool, show a fenced
`bash` usage example, and note requirements. Use `### <tool>` subsections when there is more
than one.

## 11. Roadmap — *Optional*

Short bulleted list of planned/in-progress work with status, linking
`DESIGN_DOCUMENT.md#9-open-items` for the full list. Drop the section if there's nothing
public to promise.

## 12. Compatibility — *Required*

`| Component | Version |` table: Home Assistant min version, Python, and any
key runtime dep. Keep versions aligned with `manifest.json` / `hacs.json`.

## 13. License — *Required*

One line naming the license and linking `LICENSE`.

## Conventions

- **Horizontal rules** (`---`) separate every top-level (`##`) section.
- **Tables** for any field/sensor/service/version reference list; prose for concepts.
- **Bold lead-ins** on feature and explanation bullets.
- **Call-outs**: `> ⚠️` for warnings, `> **Heads up:**`/`> **Note:**` for advisories.
- **Collapsible `<details>`** for long optional snippets.
- **Images** live in `images/`: `dashboard.png` for the hero shot and
  `config-stepN-<slug>.png` for each wizard step. Every wizard step carries a screenshot.
- **Plain language first** — defer protocol and internals to `DESIGN_DOCUMENT.md`.
- **Release sync**: on every release update the version-bearing bits (badges resolve
  automatically; the "What's new" heading/body/link do not) and re-check the Sensors,
  Services, Configuration and Compatibility tables against the code.
